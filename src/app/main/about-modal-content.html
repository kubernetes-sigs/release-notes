  This tool is designed to view the official
  <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes" target="_blank">Kubernetes</a>
  release notes within the browser. The note contents are directly provided via the
  <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release" target="_blank"
    >Kubernetes SIG release team</a
  >
  and are transformed per release into JSON format to be consumable by this application. The release
  notes can be filtered by release version, kind, area, SIG or documentation. It is also possible to
  do full text search by querying the <em>Search</em> input box at the top of the page.
